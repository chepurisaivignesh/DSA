Started learning DSA
Gone through Dr.Bari Algorithm Playlist (1-16 Videos) for knowledge about "Time and Space Complexity".
Started with Arrays:
                    Learnt difference b/w lists vs arrays
                    Methods in arrays
                    Solved some selected problems from "SUMMER VACATION DSA PROBLEM SHEET" by CodeSkool in Arrays on GeeksForGeeks.
                      
Problem1:
Given a sorted array arr[] of distinct integers. Sort the array into a wave-like array and return it
In other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such that arr[1] >= arr[2] <= arr[3] >= arr[4] <= arr[5].....
If there are multiple solutions, find the lexicographically smallest one.
  Example 1:
    Input:
      n = 5
      arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
    Output: 2 1 4 3 5
      Explanation: Array elements after 
      sorting it in wave form are 
      2 1 4 3 5.
Solution1:
def convertToWave(self, n : int, a : List[int]) -> None:
       for i in range(0,n-1,2):
           a[i],a[i+1]=a[i+1],a[i]
       print(" ".join(str(x) for x in a))
